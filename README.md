# 🏟️ Basic Sports Betting Platform Script

A simple command-line Python script simulating a basic sports betting experience. The user selects a match, places a bet on a team, and the result is determined randomly. Based on the outcome, the user's winnings are calculated.

## 📌 Features

- Simulates betting on two predefined sports matches.
- Displays match odds and accepts user input for team and bet amount.
- Randomly determines the winner.
- Calculates and displays winnings or loss.

## 🖥️ Demo

```bash
Available matches:
1. Team A vs Team B
2. Team C vs Team D
Select a match (1 or 2): 1

Team A vs Team B - Odds:
Team A: 1.8
Team B: 2.2
Enter the team you want to bet on: Team A
Enter your bet amount: $100

Match Result: Team A wins!
Congratulations! You won $180.00
```
